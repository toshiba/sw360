/**
 * <p>
 * A class managing the OAuth access token required for a request to a SW360
 * server.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An instance of this class can be asked to execute a request with a valid
 * access token. The request to be executed is specified using a function that
 * accepts an access token and returns a future result. The management of the
 * token is fully handled by this class: On first access, the token is obtained
 * asynchronously and then cached. The token is valid for a certain time span,
 * typically one hour. When a request with the token yields a 401 Unauthorized
 * error, this is detected by inspecting the future for the result of the
 * request execution. The cache for the token is then invalidated. This causes
 * a new token to be requested the next time a client asks for one.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are thread-safe; so requests requiring an access
 * token can be triggered from multiple threads. If multiple threads ask for an
 * access token concurrently, the class ensures that only a single token
 * request is sent to the authentication server.
 * </p>
