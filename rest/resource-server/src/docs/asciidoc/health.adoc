=== Health

The Health resource is used to give an information about the health status.
A response with a detailed status can only be provided, if the `application properties file`
for the spring configuration contains the following settings:

```
endpoints:
  enabled: false
  info:
    enabled: true
    sensitive: true
  health:
    enabled: true
    sensitive: false

```

Additional behaviour can be configured following
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.5.3.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready[the Spring Boot Actuator documentation].
